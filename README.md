# Code Refactor Starter Code
**##Description**
This page was created as a mockup marketing homepage for the week 01 challenge of the UCD Coding Bootcamp course - Module 1. Goal was to create a web page which included semantic HTML elements, demonstrated a logical structure of the elements (independent of styling and position), ensured image elements had accessible alt attributes, heading attributes were in sequential order, and the title element was concise and descriptive. 
**##Goal and Outcome**
The goal of creating this page was to show my understanding of the HTML and CSS concepts learned in module 1 of the coding bootcamp. 
I learned that I need to be better at time management, not overthink terminology like "accessibility" (At first I thought I needed to develop the ability for users to have the page read aloud, etc.), and take the time to document of all of my changes clearly to show that I am grasping the knowledge and training being provided. I also need to take advantage of office hours and 1x1 coaching time. 
I am not proud of this submission, especially because I am turning it in late, but I did learn a lot by making mistakes and playing around with the elements, atrributes, tags, etc. I simply ran out of time and was not able to optimize the CSS as much as I could/should have. I know that I could have done much better, but time management is something I need to improve on to do well in this class.
